// Mobile rendering of a tmux agent pane, mirroring the TUI's live mode:
// the server streams `capture-pane` snapshots (src/server/live_ws.rs)
// and this component renders them as real DOM text inside a NATIVELY
// scrolling container. There is no tmux copy-mode, no wheel synthesis,
// no momentum re-implementation, and the agent keeps running while the
// user reads. (The alt-screen forward mode below is the one exception:
// its scrollback lives inside the app, so touch drags are synthesized
// into wheel notches, with gain and a decaying momentum tail.)
//
// Reading model (mirrors the TUI's "capture window follows the scroll
// offset", adapted for a network hop):
//
//   live    — pinned to the live edge. The capture window is the screen
//             plus a small scrollback buffer (LIVE_WINDOW_SCREENS), kept
//             small enough for fast echo but big enough that a peek-up
//             lands on real content instead of the blank history spacer.
//   reading — the user scrolled past the buffer. One window request
//             covers the ENTIRE history; the spacer (sized from tmux's
//             #{history_size}) already made the area scrollable, so a
//             flick lands wherever it lands and the content fills in
//             underneath it in one round trip. The stream keeps flowing
//             at idle cadence (the agent runs on, like the TUI); there
//             is no hold/freeze.
//
// The reading position is stable without a freeze because above-viewport
// pixels are invariant by construction: spacer rows convert into real
// rows 1:1 as content arrives, and when the agent appends k lines the
// spacer grows by k while the capture window slides down by k, which
// cancels. The browser-preserved scrollTop keeps the same lines in view
// with no compensation.
//
// The soft keyboard never resizes tmux. Rows are derived from the
// LARGEST container height seen for the current width (the no-keyboard
// size); a keyboard cycle only shrinks the visible part of the scroller.
// While the keyboard has the container shrunk below that latched height,
// the live-edge scroll target anchors the CURSOR near the viewport
// bottom (see liveScrollTarget) so the agent's prompt stays in view; at
// full height the target is the literal bottom and the whole screen is
// visible, exactly like a terminal.
