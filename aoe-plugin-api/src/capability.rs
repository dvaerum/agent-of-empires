//! Capability taxonomy and trust levels for the plugin system.
//!
//! A capability gates runtime access to a resource that can affect user data,
//! host state, the OS, or the network. Static contributions (commands,
//! keybinds, themes, ui, status, panes) are NOT capabilities; they are plain
//! manifest sections that need no grant. A capability is what the one-time
//! install prompt asks the user to approve, and what a persisted grant is
//! pinned to.
//!
//! Capabilities are open strings so new permissions do not require an API
//! version bump. The host rejects strings it does not recognize.
