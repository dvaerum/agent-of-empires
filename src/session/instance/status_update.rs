/// Five conditions, and each one has cost a bug:
///
/// - tmux has to have given us an activity stamp at all; without one there is
///   nothing to compare and every poll captures.
/// - The pane must have drawn nothing since the last capture. Anything drawn
///   could have changed the verdict.
/// - The last capture must have been taken *after* the second the stamp names.
///   `#{window_activity}` is an epoch second, and the poll runs twice a second,
///   so a capture taken inside that second can have read the screen before a
///   later frame in it: equal stamps then said "unchanged" about a screen that
///   had changed, and a hookless agent whose last frame shared a second with
///   its previous one stayed Running for good (#3624). Waiting for a capture
///   past the second costs one trailing capture and makes the comparison mean
///   what it claims.
/// - The session must have no hook file, since a hook write changes the
///   verdict without the pane drawing anything.
/// - No proposal may be waiting on its confirming poll. The pane that produced
///   a hold is exactly the one that then goes quiet, so skipping here would
///   leave the proposal unresolved and the session pinned on its previous
///   status until new output arrived, which is the failure this whole path
///   exists to end.
