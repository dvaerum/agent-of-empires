//! Always-compiled, ACP-free model of the merged MCP server set (#1996).
//!
//! AoE assembles an effective MCP server set from up to four layers
//! (`agent-native` -> `global` -> `per-profile` -> `project-local`, higher wins
//! per server name). `acp::mcp_config` used to own both the parsing and the
//! merge, but it returned ACP `McpServer` wire types and dropped
//! the layer label on merge, so the unified management surface had nowhere to
//! read the merged set, its provenance, or its shadowing.
//!
//! This module is the single resolver for both jobs. It lives outside the serve
//! gate (like [`super::project_mcp`]) so the TUI panel, the CLI, and the
//! always-compiled drift store can read the model without depending on the ACP
//! schema. Serve-side forwarding consumes the SAME resolver and converts only
//! the winning set to ACP just before sending, so what the user sees and what
//! the agent receives can never diverge.
//!
//! Secret values (env values, header values) are kept in memory because
//! forwarding and the drift store need them, but every display path goes through
//! [`ProjectMcpServer::redacted_summary`], so names reach a screen, a log, or
//! CLI output and values never do.
