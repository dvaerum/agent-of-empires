//! Acp worker supervisor.
//!
//! Owns a per-aoe-process map of session_id -> AcpClient handles. Spawns
//! the ACP agent subprocess on demand, bridges its events into the
//! per-AppState `acp_events_tx` broadcast channel, and fires push
//! notifications for ApprovalRequested events.
//!
//! Watchdog: when an agent's ACP connection task ends (subprocess exit,
//! transport break) the drain task respawns it. Up to
//! `MAX_RESPAWNS_IN_WINDOW` respawns are allowed inside `RESTART_WINDOW`;
//! beyond that the session is parked and an `AgentStartupError` event
//! is published so the UI can surface "session crashed" instead of
//! going silent. A connection that fails before it establishes a session
//! is not respawned here: its own `AgentStartupError` is the diagnosis,
//! and the reconciler retries it on its cadence under its own budget.
//!
//! Producer side: `Supervisor::spawn(session_id, config)` creates an
//! AcpClient and a background task that drains its events.
//!
//! Consumer side: `Supervisor::send_prompt(session_id, text)` and
//! `Supervisor::resolve_permission(session_id, nonce, decision)` route
//! through the held client.
