# Structured View Internals

Contributor reference for how the structured view (ACP) subsystem works. Users want the [Structured View overview](../../structured-view.md) and its guides instead.

aoe is the ACP *client*; each agent (Claude Code, Gemini, `aoe-agent`, etc.) is the *server*. The daemon (`aoe serve`) supervises one detached worker per session and brokers the protocol between the worker and the web/TUI clients.

## Worker lifecycle and persistence

Workers run as detached `aoe __acp-runner` processes that outlive the daemon. `aoe serve --stop` drops the daemon connection without terminating the runner; a later daemon reattaches over the control socket. In-flight turns survive daemon stop, crash, suspend, and build-only updates while the runner generation remains compatible. A runner-protocol generation upgrade is an explicit interruption boundary. Use `aoe acp stop|kill <session>` for manual termination.

Each runner registers at `<app_dir>/acp-workers/<session_id>.json` (PID, socket path, cached ACP session id, `build_version`, `runner_version`); the same dir holds the per-session `.control.sock` and `.log` (runner stderr drain). `aoe ps --acp --dead` lists them.

The runner is the ACP protocol terminator. It owns the handshake, the turn, and every JSON-RPC id on the agent stdin; the daemon uses length-framed control protocol v3 over `<session_id>.control.sock`. The legacy `<session_id>.sock` remains only as a path derivation base and a liveness probe for generation 1 records.

Because notifications and turn completion now share one ordered channel, a turn's terminal event can no longer overtake the chunks that preceded it, which was possible while the two travelled over separate sockets.

`runner_version` is an attachment-compatibility generation, separate from liveness and `build_version`. A live incompatible runner is reaped before replacement. If its event log shows an in-flight turn, the daemon records `Stopped { reason: "runner_protocol_upgraded" }`; it cannot truthfully drain a protocol it cannot attach to.

- **One owner per runner generation.** The daemon tracks each session in `acp::runner_lifecycle`: every spawn, attach and respawn is admitted under a lease for a fresh epoch, and that epoch is stamped on the runner's registry record as `generation`. Shutdown, the reaper, the drain task's respawn and the reconciler's resume all act through the current lease and refuse a stale one, so a spawn that completes after a stop tears its own runner down instead of installing it, and a reaper snapshot cannot remove a replacement. A stop is not finished until the runner is proven dead: the group gets SIGTERM, then SIGKILL, and the session stays `stopping` (`acp_worker_state`), holding prompts and refusing resumes, while the reconciler retries every tick (#3487). Only the runner pid's exit is proven; a descendant that ignored both signals can outlive the settled session.
- **Process-group termination.** Runners are group leaders via `setsid`; every termination path signals the whole group so the node ACP wrapper and the SDK child die with the runner instead of reparenting to PID 1. A `SIGKILL`'d runner can still leak (it cannot run cleanup), so prefer the verbs over `kill -9`.
- **Self-termination watchdog.** The reapers above need a live daemon, so each runner also polls its own registry record and self-destructs when abandoned: record vanished, superseded by a newer runner, or detached with no daemon for longer than a 48h retention window (reset on every reattach; a pending `aoe acp restart` for the runner's own generation is exempt). Backstop for a daemon that dies without killing its runners (#1921).
- **Restart markers are per generation.** `aoe acp restart` and `aoe session add-project` write `<session_id>.restart` holding the generation they stopped. The reaper honors it only for that generation, an explicit stop clears it, and a marker older than the newest generation stamped on one of the session's runners is discarded wherever it is found.
- **Detach buffer.** Only agent notifications and `PromptCompleted` survive detach. The queue is bounded by both frame count and exact encoded bytes; oldest notifications are shed first. Queue ownership transfers after write and flush, with no peer acknowledgement or disk journal. Delivery is therefore best effort, not durable or exactly once; a disconnect after kernel acceptance but before local commit may duplicate one frame. A stalled writer times out and releases the serial accept slot.
- **Calls outstanding at detach.** Reverse and forward calls are attachment-scoped. On disconnect, reverse calls are cancelled toward the agent and queued replies are discarded. A pending conversation reset retains runner-side bookkeeping until its result commits the new session identity; it does not replay the old caller's reply. Other late forward answers are ignored. `terminal/release` is globally idempotent cleanup, including after daemon restart, so it needs no tombstone cache.
- **Mid-turn reattach.** `ResumeSession` obtains the runner's committed session identity, waiting for a reset sent by the previous daemon to settle. It never sends ACP `session/new` or `session/load`. `PromptCompleted` survives detach and reports the adopted turn's outcome; rate-limit errors produce `RateLimit` before `Stopped { reason: "rate_limited" }`. A new local prompt supersedes adoption before rearming its terminal state. The runner queues attachment-scoped `PromptStarted` before sending the agent request, and only the matching canonical request id may resolve that local prompt. Older completions remain ignored after local delivery. A 30-second resume-idle watchdog remains a fallback. Incompatible runner generations follow the explicit interruption path above.
- **Launcher override (`AOE_ACP_RUNNER_EXE`).** The spawn re-execs `std::env::current_exe()`, so there is no seam to interpose a launcher without patching aoe. Set `AOE_ACP_RUNNER_EXE` to a wrapper and the daemon launches it with the same `__acp-runner` argv, and only then adds `AOE_ACP_RUNNER_REAL_EXE` (the real aoe path to re-exec) plus `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`/`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` (both wiped by the spawn's `env_clear`, so a `systemd-run --user` wrapper can still reach the user manager). The motivating use is re-homing each runner into its own `systemd-run --user --scope`: `setsid` gives the runner a new process group but not a new cgroup, so under `KillMode=control-group` a `systemctl restart` of the daemon's own unit would SIGKILL every runner in that cgroup, defeating the outlive-the-daemon design above. A per-session scope keeps the runner in a sibling cgroup that the restart cannot reach. Unset or empty preserves the default spawn byte-for-byte.

Live-registry repair shares the per-session view-transition lock through its deferred disk write. It skips sessions undergoing a transition and revalidates the sampled runner owner before admission, so disabling structured view cannot be undone by a stale repair.

## Build and runner upgrades

Build identity and runner protocol generation are independent. Same-generation build changes remain attachable: idle workers are replaced immediately, while in-flight workers drain and respawn at the next idle boundary. A runner-generation mismatch is never attached; it is reaped before replacement and any in-flight turn receives the explicit `runner_protocol_upgraded` terminal reason.

`aoe ps --acp` tags a not-yet-respawned worker `(stale)` in its BUILD column. The new binary takes effect only once the daemon restarts; `aoe update` offers that restart, and `aoe serve --restart` replays the host/port/mode/auth/passphrase it was launched with. Restart only touches daemons started by `aoe serve --daemon`; foreground/systemd/launchd daemons are left to their manager. A daemon whose process cannot be verified at all (most often another user's, where `kill(pid, 0)` returns `EPERM`) is neither restarted nor treated as absent: `aoe update` warns that a daemon may still be running the old build and names its owner as the one who has to restart it, and the `serve.*` lifecycle files are preserved rather than swept. See #1754, #1794, #3225.

## Session deletion semantics

`session/delete` fires only on permanent removal (purging a session, or disabling the structured view, which discards the conversation). Reversible teardown (`aoe acp stop`, snooze, archive, trash, idle auto-stop) deliberately does not fire it, so the transcript stays on disk and the next respawn resumes via `session/load` instead of resetting context (#1710). Trash is the reversible middle state between archive and permanent delete (#2489): deleting a session moves it to the trash by default (`session.delete_to_trash`), where it keeps its transcript, worktree, branch, and container until it is restored, purged, or auto-purged after `session.trash_retention_days` (0 = keep forever). Trash uses the same `shutdown` (not `shutdown_and_delete`) path as archive; purge is the historical permanent-delete path. Retention auto-purge is enforced by the `aoe serve` daemon only (a startup sweep plus an hourly tick); without a running daemon, expired trash is purged on the next daemon start or by an explicit manual purge (`aoe rm --purge`, `aoe session empty-trash`, or the web "Delete permanently" action). When the daemon permanently deletes a structured session (the web action or retention auto-purge) it fires a best-effort ACP `session/delete` (2s timeout) when a stored session id exists, then proceeds with the kill path (`session/cancel`, SIGTERM, on-disk cleanup). Adapters that implement it release adapter-side state (e.g. claude-agent-acp 0.37.0+ clears its on-disk session record); others reply `-32601 method_not_found`, logged at debug under `target = "acp.protocol"` with an `adapter=` field (#1404). The CLI purges have no running worker, so they delete only the local event-store transcript and leave adapter-side state alone.

## Who owns the state

The daemon folds the event stream once per WebSocket connection into two
projections, so clients do not re-derive them:

- **Control state**: turn flags, pending approvals and elicitations, usage, plan, modes, slash commands. Shipped as `{"kind":"reduced_state","seq","state":<AcpState>,"unchanged":[...]}` on connect and after every event. `unchanged` names the cold fields (commands, modes, config options, recent diffs, background agents) the socket already holds, which the daemon omits rather than re-serializing; a client keeps what it has for those. The connect frame is folded over the WHOLE session even when the client dials with a `since` cursor, because it is a whole-state snapshot the clients adopt verbatim.
- **Transcript rows**: `{"kind":"transcript_snapshot","rows":[...]}` on connect plus a `{"kind":"transcript_delta", ...}` (`Append` / `Patch` / `Remove`, reconciled by row id) per event, and `GET /api/sessions/{id}/acp/replay?view=rows` for history. Presentation stays client-side: markdown, tool cards, path shortening, diff rendering.

Raw event frames still stream for what the daemon does not model (the worker-lifecycle latches, monitor and wakeup badges, the usage cost baseline, rejected prompts, the web's optimistic turn counters). A client that reads only the projections can pass `?frames=0` to skip them; the native view does, so reopening a long session no longer ships it the whole event log. A `notice` row carries a failed startup, a dead turn, a refused mode switch, or a rate-limit auto-resume; the native view renders it inline and the web skips it, since the web shows the same information as a dismissible banner.

The daemon also owns prompt dispatch. `POST /acp/prompt` runs
`acp::dispatch::decide` and returns `sent`, `steered`, or `queued`. The
server-owned queue persists follow-ups until its turn-end drain delivers them.
Cancelling and compacting turns are always queued; a dormant worker is sent the
prompt so the request can wake it.

## Conversation persistence and context primer

Transcripts persist in a SQLite event log. The web client mirrors each session's reduced state into `localStorage` under `aoe:acp-state:v1:<session_id>` (7-day expiry, falls back to full server replay past the per-origin quota) so a reload hydrates instantly and only fetches the seq-delta. `clearAcpCache` and the delete handler drop the entry so a recreated session id never shows the prior transcript.

On a cold open (cache miss) the client loads recent-first instead of folding the whole transcript from seq 0 before first paint (#2236). The replay endpoint takes a `before` cursor (`GET /api/sessions/{id}/acp/replay?before=<seq>&limit=N`): it returns the `limit` events sitting closest below `before` in ascending order, aligned to a user-turn boundary when more history remains so a page never seams a split turn. The client fetches the tail (`before` = max), renders it immediately, and on a long session also pulls a small `since=0` prefix to project the pinned handshake snapshot (capabilities, slash palette, agent/model) without which the composer would be crippled. Scrolling to the top (or the "Load earlier messages" button) first reveals rows the client already holds, then pages older history via `before` (lowest loaded seq), prepending it with the scroll position frozen. Each page is fetched twice, once for frames and once for `view=rows`; a failure on either leg abandons the page rather than advancing the cursor past rows that never arrived. The render window grows as rows arrive so live turns never fold earlier messages back behind the control. The forward `since`/`limit` contract (WS catch-up, cached-reload seq-delta) is unchanged.

If context restoration fails (the agent's stored session is gone), the view falls back to a fresh session, renders a "Conversation context reset" callout, and offers a one-shot "Resume with prior context" banner. That calls `GET /api/sessions/{id}/acp/context-primer?before_seq=<reset-seq>`, which walks the event log and returns a compact markdown recap of the last ~20 turns (capped ~24k chars, bulky tool I/O elided). The primer is pre-filled into the composer and never auto-sent. `aoe-agent` ships as sources inside `aoe` and is installed into the data dir on demand; a digest over its lockfile and sources decides whether an installed copy is current, so a local edit that skips the release build is invisible to it.

`aoe-agent` persists each native conversation in
`${AOE_ARTIFACT_DIR}/aoe-agent-<native-session-id>.jsonl`. A driven `/clear`
attempts to create and flush the new empty transcript before acknowledging the
new ID, but the create is best-effort: it makes the artifact directory as
needed, so the clear still succeeds and the session runs ephemerally only when
the transcript cannot be created, for example under a non-writable directory.
Late turns from the old ID stay in its own
file, and `session/load` reads only the requested ID. A later load of that ID
then finds no transcript and, like any missing or unreadable one, fails
explicitly rather than reporting an empty successful resume; the view surfaces
that failure as a context reset. Without an artifact directory (for example,
capability probes), sessions are ephemeral and load is unavailable.
Only completed user/assistant text exchanges are persisted, not tool calls.

Legacy `transcript.jsonl` files from before native-ID scoping are left
untouched on disk. The old format recorded neither native IDs nor `/clear`
boundaries, so it cannot safely seed a resumed conversation: the first resume
of such a session reports context reset and starts fresh. The saved file is
never sent to the model automatically; inspect it to recover wanted text
manually.

## Permission modes and model channels

Modes come from `NewSessionResponse.modes`; the picker shows whatever the adapter reports. Gemini's `auto_edit`/`yolo` `ApprovalMode` names fold onto `acceptEdits`/`bypassPermissions`. YOLO (`[session] yolo_mode_default`) fires `session/set_mode("bypassPermissions")` after `session/new`, best-effort. claude-agent-acp gates `bypassPermissions` on the `ALLOW_BYPASS=1` daemon env var; without it `set_mode` returns "not available" and the session stays `default` (surfaced as a non-blocking amber notice).

Model and reasoning-effort selectors arrive over two wire mechanisms, normalized into one dropdown:

- **`SessionUpdate::ConfigOptionUpdate`** (stabilized in claude-agent-acp v0.37.0): the adapter emits a full snapshot of every selector whenever any one changes; the client replaces its cached list wholesale.
- **`unstable_session_model`** capability: `SessionModelState` on the `session/new`/`session/load` response, switched with `session/set_model`.

If both are present, `config_option` wins (it has a push/echo path). Because `session/set_model` only acks, the client synthesizes the confirming update. The UI is pessimistic (chip shows the prior value until the adapter pushes a confirming `config_option_update`) to avoid snap-back on slow tunnels. The `Default` effort drops any session-level effort pin (resolved per model upstream). The cached selector list clears on `AgentSwitched` but survives `/clear` (capabilities are process-scoped).

Approval nonces are server-generated and single-use; aoe never reveals them to the agent. Resolving an already-resolved approval (concurrent decision, watchdog) clears the card quietly rather than erroring.

## Stuck-turn watchdogs

Three layers recover a turn that stops progressing, in increasing depth:

1. **Cancel escalation.** The agent ignores `session/cancel` mid-tool (commonly a `block: true` TaskOutput on a wedged shell). After a ~10s grace the daemon ends the ACP connection, SIGTERMs the runner, and respawns via `session/load`. Banner reason `agent_unresponsive`.
2. **Force end turn (client).** No streaming chunk for a fixed 30s threshold with no tool in flight surfaces a "Force end turn" button that publishes a synthetic `Stopped` plus a best-effort `session/cancel`. With a tool in flight the spinner shows an elapsed label instead and the button stays hidden so it cannot discard in-flight progress (#1100, #1176). A latched compaction phase also hides it and relabels the spinner "Compaction in progress": `/compact` runs 90 to 170s with zero frames, so it trips the threshold on every run, and force-ending it is the same abort the daemon-side #2898 fixed (#3219).
3. **Silent-orphan watchdog (daemon).** The adapter finished streaming but never sent the `PromptResponse` that closes `session/prompt` (upstream claude-agent-acp#688). Fires only when all hold for the current prompt: `tool_calls_in_flight` is empty, at least one progress notification has arrived, and none has arrived for `silent_orphan_grace_secs` (120; reduced to a fixed 20s fast grace once a cost-populated `UsageUpdate` lands). Out-of-band notifications (mode/command/usage-without-cost) do not reset the timer. On fire: a turn that already emitted its cost-populated `UsageUpdate` with no off-protocol work pending ends cleanly as `prompt_complete`, with no cancel and no respawn (#2237); anything else gets `session/cancel`, 10s grace, SIGTERM, respawn via `session/load` (#1240). Nonzero grace below 120 is clamped up; debug builds honor `AOE_SILENT_ORPHAN_GRACE_MS` and `AOE_ACP_SIMULATE_ORPHAN_NEXT_PROMPT=1` (single-shot, compiled out of release).

**Off-protocol work suppression (#1360, #1401).** Some Claude SDK features go quiet with no ACP signal; the watchdog lifts the grace to `OFF_PROTOCOL_WORK_GRACE_FLOOR` (30 min) for the rest of the prompt:

- `Agent` tool `isAsync: true` (#1360): a per-connection tailer follows the sub-agent's transcript and the launch is tracked in an in-flight set (keyed by agent_id, removed when the tailer reports terminal). The between-prompt watchdog treats a non-empty set as work in flight, so it cannot fire while an async agent runs. Because tracking is now precise, an `isAsync` launch does NOT latch the 30-min floor (that stays only for untracked backgrounded Bash). See #2573.
- `/compact` (#2898): detected from the adapter's `Compacting...` / `Compacting completed.` / `Compacting failed...` text chunks, since it surfaces no typed ACP signal. The start marker latches the floor so a large compaction is never cut short, and either terminal marker drops it. The same markers now also publish `ConversationCompactionStarted` / `ConversationCompacted` so both clients know the phase and stop reading its silence as a wedge (#3219); the detector is not profile-gated, so daemon and clients cannot disagree about whether a compaction is running. Neither terminal marker arms the between-prompt watchdog: on a cancel the adapter emits the failure marker AFTER the turn's own `Stopped`, and reading that tail as an agent-initiated turn left the session Running for the whole stall grace with nothing running.
- `Bash` `run_in_background: true` (#1401): detected from `raw_input.run_in_background` at start AND the `Command running in background with ID:` completion text (defense in depth). Fire-and-forget, so once a cost-populated `UsageUpdate` arrives the suppression is dropped and recovery falls back to the fast grace (#1858). One exception to the floor (#2645): if the model then streams a partial message and the stream dies mid-chunk (the last timer refresh was a `Progress`, not a `BashOutput` poll), the watchdog treats it as a dead stream and recovers on the normal per-prompt base grace (~2 min) rather than the 30-min floor. A bash still being polled refreshes the timer via tool activity, so a genuinely-running background command keeps the floor.

**Between-prompt stalled stream (#2573).** An agent-initiated turn (a monitor / `/loop` resume with no aoe `session/prompt`) that streamed output but reported no cost-bearing end-of-turn marker and scheduled no wake is a stalled stream, not a parked monitor (which always carries a `wake_at`) and not backgrounded Bash (which latches the floor). It recovers on a dedicated `BETWEEN_PROMPT_STALL_GRACE` (120s) instead of the 30-min floor. Separately, `has_in_flight_turn` (the build-stale respawn probe) counts a launched/progressing background agent with no terminal as in-flight so a respawn cannot interrupt it mid-work and drop its transcript, bounded by `BACKGROUND_AGENT_STALE_AFTER_MS` so a crashed tailer cannot pin the probe forever. The pre-0.55 stdin `\n` keepalive (#2455) is gone: the `claude-agent-acp` floor is now 0.55.0, which ships the upstream fix (claude-agent-acp#825/#835) for turns that went idle without a `PromptResponse`.

**Scheduled-wakeup suppression (#1401).** A `ScheduleWakeup` with `delaySeconds: N` is deliberate off-protocol idling (a monitor or `/loop` run), so it is treated like the off-protocol kinds above: the watchdog is suppressed until `wakeup_at + OFF_PROTOCOL_WORK_GRACE_FLOOR` (30 min), and for the rest of the prompt the effective grace stays at that floor rather than dropping to the 20s fast grace even after a cost-populated `UsageUpdate` lands. The deadline is a monotonic `Instant` so wall-clock jumps don't perturb it. Multiple wakeups extend, never shorten. A daemon crash during sleep tears the prompt loop down, so the next attach starts fresh. Earlier this suppressed only until `wakeup_at + silent_orphan_grace_secs` and then re-armed with the fast grace, which killed monitor turns ~20s after the wake window lapsed.

## Rate-limit handling

When the backend reports `errorKind: "rate_limit"` on `session/prompt`, aoe treats it as a clean terminal state, not a crash: it emits a typed `RateLimit` event (banner reads its reset time) plus `Stopped { reason: "rate_limited" }`, drops the worker handle, and does not respawn. Earlier behavior respawned into the same limit and burned the restart budget. The park is durable: it is the latest `RateLimit` (or the cap's terminal `Stopped`) with no prompt, agent switch or unrelated stop after it, so a failed resume's `AgentStartupError` neither clears the banner nor disarms auto-resume, and a limit hit during the handshake fails the spawn as `AcpError::RateLimited` and parks the same way (#3514). A daemon restart respects the parked signal in the event log. `RateLimitInfo.resets_at` is optional: it is filled only from a reset the agent attributed to a window it rejected (claude-agent-acp forwards that on a `usage_update`'s `_meta._claude/rateLimit`, never in the error itself), and stays `None` otherwise so no fabricated time reaches the UI (#3152). Optional opt-in `[acp] rate_limit_auto_resume` has the reconciler resume the same worker once `resets_at` plus a fixed 15s grace passes, or, when no reset was reported, an hour after the park with the wait doubling per redelivery already spent (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 16h, so the cap's five attempts span 31 hours rather than five, #3688); it is vendor-agnostic and bounded by a minimum park window so a misbehaving adapter cannot drive a respawn loop. Each resume re-delivers the interrupted prompt once (`pending_initial_turn`, #3028); that redelivery is capped at 5 per streak, so a limit that keeps rejecting parks the session on a terminal `Stopped { reason: "rate_limit_exhausted_retries" }` instead of re-sending the same prompt forever (#3688). The streak is counted from the persisted `RateLimitAutoResumed` breadcrumbs since the last organic turn end or agent switch, skipping manual RESUME NOW resumes and any whose spawn failed before the redelivery landed; see `EventStore::rate_limit_redelivery_streak`. The park has no schedule, so nothing un-parks it on a timer: `dispatch::decide` treats it like idle dormancy, which is what makes the banner's "send a new prompt" true, and a prompt already on the server queue when the cap fires releases the park through `reap_rate_limit_resumes` instead. The streak is kept in a per-session row outside the pruned transcript, so `acp.replay_events` cannot evict it at any supported history cap; sessions that predate the row derive from the log until their next relevant event plants one. The banner's "Continue in another agent" CTA runs the agent-switch path below.

## Crash-loop park

A worker that exits within ~10s (broken command, missing adapter, handshake failure) used to respawn every reconciler tick silently. Now the runner logs a `warn` on the `acp.runner` target (session id, exit status, `elapsed_ms`), and the reconciler enforces a respawn budget: more than 5 (re)spawns in a rolling 60s parks the session, publishes one `AgentStartupError` (red startup banner), and stops auto-respawning. This is looser than the supervisor's in-flight restart budget (3 in 60s). Recovery: dashboard retry, `aoe acp restart <session>`, or an `aoe serve` restart (clears the in-memory budget for one more bounded burst). Empty 0-byte worker logs are swept on teardown.

## Agent switching

`POST /api/sessions/{id}/acp/switch-agent` stops the current worker, spawns the target, persists `agent_name` and clears `acp_session_id` (the old id belongs to a different vendor), and emits `AgentSwitched { from, to, reason }` so reducers drop backend-specific transient state (rate-limit banner, in-flight tool, usage, mode pills, commands) and the transcript shows a divider. The modal then pre-fills the composer with a context-primer recap (and the `unprocessed_prompt` if the user's last prompt triggered the limit); never auto-sent. CLI: `aoe acp switch-agent <session> <target> [--model <name>]`. `reason` is `manual` or `rate_limited`.

## Agent profiles

Each agent has two profile sources, kept aligned by registry key:

- **Server (Rust), `src/acp/agent_profiles.rs`:** `parent_meta_namespaces`, `clear_aliases`, and the `supports_exit_plan_mode` / `supports_wakeup_tools` capability gates.
- **Frontend (TS), `web/src/lib/agentProfiles.ts`:** the card-classifier alias map (`shell` → execute card, etc.), claude-specialized capabilities (`todos`, `skills`, `wakeup`), the MCP prefix list, and special-title patterns matched only when the capability is on.

Profiles are conservative: an unverified tool surface is omitted rather than guessed, so the generic tool card is the fallback. Mode-picker sources resolve in order: a `category:"mode"` config option (OpenCode, claude-agent-acp v0.37.0+), then the ACP `SessionModeState` `available_modes` channel (older claude), then, for claude-family agents only, the built-in Default/Plan/Accept-edits/Yolo taxonomy. Subagent indentation (nested child tool cards) needs the adapter to emit `_meta.<namespace>.parentToolUseId` (claude-agent-acp emits `_meta.claudeCode.parentToolUseId`). An off-protocol subagent that streams no children (opencode's `task`, which runs in its own session and returns only a final `<task_result>` report) is instead classified by its immutable wire tool name via the profile's `subagentToolNames`; it renders as a childless subagent card showing the delegated prompt and the returned report. Because `ToolCallUpdated` overwrites `tool.name` with the human title, that classification keys on `ToolCall.raw_name` (the original `ToolCallStarted.name`), not the mutable title. To diagnose a tool rendering as a generic card, read the tool-start WS frame's `tool.kind`/`tool.name` in devtools and compare against the profile; the alias map only fires when `kind` is `"other"`.

## Security model

- `fs/read_text_file` / `fs/write_text_file`: agents never touch the disk directly; aoe reads and writes on their behalf and enforces sandbox roots (the session's worktree plus any explicit `--repo` paths).
- `terminal/*`: the command runs in aoe's process, in the worktree, or inside the sandbox container via `docker exec`.
- Approval nonces are server-generated and single-use; a compromised agent cannot synthesize one. `AOE_TOKEN` is not forwarded to the agent subprocess.
- **Sandboxed sessions** wrap the agent argv in `docker exec`; the daemon stays on the host. `fs/*` requests are translated from container paths to host paths before the inside-roots check; the unix socket stays on the host and the runner proxies the agent's stdio across the boundary. Path translation only covers the workspace mounts; config, credential, and `extra_volumes` mounts are rejected by the worktree-only inside-roots check. The image must bundle the ACP adapters or the handshake exits with status 127.

## Global tuning (`[acp]`)

```toml
[acp]
default_agent = "claude-code"
approval_timeout_secs = 300
destructive_require_double_confirm = true
max_concurrent_workers = 100
replay_events = 0                 # 0 = unlimited; caps per-session rows and the web client buffer (#1111)
node_path = ""
show_tool_durations = true
compaction_reminder = false       # opt-in /compact nudge past the threshold (#3253)
compaction_reminder_percent = 75  # 1..99; independent of the meter's fixed 90% warn colour
silent_orphan_grace_secs = 120    # 0 disables (#1240)
auto_stop_idle_secs = 3600        # 0 disables; next prompt respawns the worker
rate_limit_auto_resume = false
```

Cold-start resume parallelism is a fixed constant (4 parallel worker spawns/attaches, keeping Node bootup memory bounded on laptops/Pis; #1088), clamped at runtime to `min(4, max_concurrent_workers).max(1)`. `auto_stop_idle_secs` stops an event-idle worker with no in-flight turn (the session keeps its sidebar slot; the timeline shows `Stopped { reason: "idle_auto_stop" }`; the next prompt respawns and resumes); mid-turn workers are never stopped, and the check runs ~once a minute. `AOE_ACP_NODE=/path/to/node` overrides Node discovery for one process.

Config migrations: v005 seeded the old `[cockpit]` section, v006 flipped its `replay_events` to unlimited, v012 renamed the section to `[acp]` (dropping the retired master switch and `default_for_claude` keys) and migrated per-session state, and v022 dropped the retired tuning knobs (`replay_bytes`, `max_concurrent_resumes`, `force_end_turn_threshold_secs`, `silent_orphan_fast_grace_secs`, `rate_limit_auto_resume_grace_secs`, `queue_drain_mode`), which are fixed constants now.
